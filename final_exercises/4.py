    You can assume that "text" contains nothing but words that consist of nothing but letters
    (no apostrophe, no hyphen, no quote symbol...), possibly followed by commas, full stops,
    colons, semicolons, question marks and exclamation marks (all with no space before, and
    with a space after if not the last character).
    Prints out lists of words with all uppercase letters changed to lowercase,
    with no duplicate, in lexicographic order, grouped together by number of letters,
    from smallest number of letters to largest number of letters.
    Observe that each list of words is preceded with 4 spaces.
